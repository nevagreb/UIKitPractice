#  Adaptive layout problem

## You're given a screen with different views. Depending on availability of a package, 
## extra button at the bottom is displayed / hidden. It also affects the spacing between 
## "cashback button" and gray container view and big black button title.

### Your task is to manage the states properly and adjust layout accordingly.
### Use TestVc to check your work.
### All layout work should be done programmatically. 
### Check attached images for better understanding.
### Use viewModel to bind data reactively of through delegates.

                                        ----------Good luck!----------
