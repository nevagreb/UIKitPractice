# Equal squares problem

## Create a square view which contains 4 equal squares with equal spacing between them.

## Mind that changing the size of the entire view should not affect its internal layout.

### All layout work should be done programmatically. 
### Use @Autolayout property wrapper to avoid writing translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false :)
### Check attached images for better understanding.

                                        ----------Good luck!----------
